## Spring 2013

This is the repository for Bill Parrott's submission for the [Introduction to Expert Systems](http://people.eecs.ku.edu/~jerzy/eecs638.html) class at the [University of Kansas](http://www.ku.edu/).

### Compiling the program
There is a makefile included with this submission that copies the necessary OPS/R2 files and compiles both parts of the assignment.

To compile the program, simply run `make`.

### Running the program
To run the project, enter `./project` after compiling. The output for the project is stored in the file `output.txt`.

The program reads from the `input.txt` file.
